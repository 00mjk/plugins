Serverless grows through its Community. We want to make sure that all the great work that contributors put not just into Serverless itself, but also into plugins they build gets visible to our community.

## [Add your plugin to the list](https://github.com/serverless/community-plugins/edit/master/plugins.json)

This is what the Community Plugins repository is for. We will assemble the best and most interesting plugins from the community to provide a standard level of quality and an easy way for users to find these plugins.

If you have ideas for features or plugins, or you know specific plugins we could include here please let us know through the [Github Issues](https://github.com/serverless/community-plugins/issues) in this repository or [add it to the list](https://github.com/serverless/community-plugins/edit/master/plugins.json)

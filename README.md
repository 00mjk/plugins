Serverless grows through its Community. We want to make sure that all the great work that contributors put not just into Serverless itself, but also into plugins they build gets visible to our community.

This is what the Community Plugins repository is for. We will assemble the best and most interesting plugins from the community to provide a standard level of quality and an easy way for users to find these plugins. Adding your plugin to this repository is of course completely voluntary and we will make sure that high levels of code and test quality will be maintained. 

We're just starting this effort, but if you have ideas for features or plugins, or you know specific plugins we could include here please let us know through the [Github Issues](https://github.com/serverless/community-plugins/issues) in this repository.
